# Automated-System-System
A simple restaurant ordering system designed to showcase and utilize various Java design patterns.
# PROBLEM
You are to implement an automated restaurant system utilizing the Command design pattern, minimally consisting of the following three commands. You will then extend this basic system in any way that you choose to demonstrate the use of additional design patterns.
- Display menu
- Submit Order
- Display tab
# SCENARIO (of the basic system)
In the basic system, we assume that all orders are from the same table (i.e., there is only one table in the restaurant). Therefore, a tab is generated by simply totaling all of the ordered items, and tabs are not stored.
The menu of the basic system will consist of just main entrees. It will not include appetizers, desserts, drinks, etc. The information for each entr√©e will just be the name of the dish ("Roast Beef", "Chicken Korma", "Jiaozi", etc.) and the price.
